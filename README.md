# Natural Disasters ETL

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build an **ETL pipeline** that extracts, transforms and loads natural disaster data into a **SQL database**.  
The processed data is then used to create visualisations with **Streamlit**.

## ETL Pipeline

- **Extract**  
  Collects natural disaster data from a SQL database.

- **Transform**  
  Cleans, standardises, and enriches the data.  

- **Load**  
  Loads the processed data into a final SQL table for analysis.

## Visualisation

- Built with Streamlit
- Uses the cleaned SQL data to show:
  - Global disaster trends
  - Country-specific insights
  - Disaster type analysis
  - Risk assessment tool
